# Practice test generator for App Academy built from:
https://github.com/souiukoto/javascript-test-generator

In addition to the features offered in the previous implementation,
this random generator gives preference to problems that have been attempted fewer times

In order to reset the recorded number of attempts, simply run 'ruby reset.rb'
